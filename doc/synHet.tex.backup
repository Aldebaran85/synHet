\subsection*{Problem definition}
A soaring number of services bases their functionality on a distribuited context where each local implementation is often realized separately from the others and the model used to represent data may be significatively different. In particular the problem analyzed take into the syntactic heterogeneity that fold several aspects about the definitions for representing data. The main aim of the project is to allow the execution of queries on datasources which have been described differently through two distinct schemas.

\subsection*{Status}
The syntactic heterogeneity is a part of the problem known as ``Schema matching'' which objective is finding a semantic relation between two objects. In order to solve
